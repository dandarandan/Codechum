by CodeChum Admin

Do you still know what being divisible by a certain number means? In case you forgot, being divisible means that the number is capable of being divided by another number without a remainder. With this knowledge, you can surely solve this problem!


Instructions:

    Input one integer.
    Make a conditional statement that contains the following conditions:
        If the integer is only divisible by 3, print "Divisible by 3"
        If the integer is only divisible by 4, print "Divisible by 4"
        If the integer is divisible by both 3 and 4, print "Divisible by 3 and 4"

Input

1. An integer

Output

The first line will contain a message prompt to input the integer.
The second line contains the appropriate message.
