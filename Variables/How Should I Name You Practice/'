//1. Cheering Squad
//
//by CodeChum Admin
//
//The annual Volley Tourney is just around the corner, and our town’s volleyball team will be joining this time around!
//To show our support, we’re planning on cheering them on in their game this Saturday!
//
//
//But oh, we don’t have enough time to practice on the chant though, so we’re planning to just flash some words
//repeatedly on a screen to serve as our visual guide as of the moment. To do that, we need to ask help from a great
//programmer and you’re the only programmer we know, so could you help us out again this time?
//
//
//Instructions:
//
//    Create two variables: one containing the uppercase character 'G' and the other with uppercase letter 'O'. You can
//    name the variable anything you want as long as it's a valid name that is accepted in C.
//        Print out the values of the variable in alternate order, twice, on separate lines, using the printf()
//        function.
//            The output generated by your code must be the same as that of the sample output.
//                An initial code with four printf()'s is provided for you. Fill them in with the appropriate
//                placeholder for a character and the variables that you created.
//
//                Output
//
//                Four lines containing a character on each.
//
//                G
//                O
//                G
//                O
//

#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
    char a = 'G';
    char b = 'O';

    printf("%c", a);
    printf("%c", b);
    printf("%c", a);
    printf("%c", a);

    return 0;

}
