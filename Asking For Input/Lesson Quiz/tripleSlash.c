/* 1. Triple Slash

by CodeChum Admin

Samurais are so awesome! I'd like to imitate their amazing sword skills some time but I just don't have the courage to harm myself, so I'd just like to print out three forward slashes (\) to digitally imitate the samurai's triple slash skill. Haha!


Sounds easy, right? Then code it now!

Output

Three lines with a single forward slash symbol.

#include<stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
	printf("\\\n\\\n\\\n");

	return 0;
}
