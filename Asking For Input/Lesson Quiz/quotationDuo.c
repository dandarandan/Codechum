/* 
 * 2. Quotation Duo

by CodeChum Admin

Quotation marks are usually paired with a similar type, like a double quote (") paired with another double quote ("), and the same goes for single quotes ('). However, I'd like to try complicating things by putting together a pair of a double quote(") and a single quote(') in one statement!

Can you do this simple challenge?

Output

The double quote and single quote in 1 line.

#include<stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
	printf("\"\'");

	return 0;
}
